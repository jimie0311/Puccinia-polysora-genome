# Puccinia-polysora-genome
Puccinia poplysora f.sp. zeae is the casual agent of southern corn rust,  which has caused epidemics in Africa, North American and Asia for several times, seriously threatening the global food safety. With global warming, southern corn rust caused by Puccinia polysora has posed an increasing risk from tropical to temperate regions including China.

Here we used HIFI and Hi-C data, succesfully assembled P. polysora isolate GD1913 to haplotype-phased and chromosome level. Please find the manuscript in bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.18.492400
