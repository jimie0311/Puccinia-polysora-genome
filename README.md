# Puccinia-polysora-genome
Puccinia poplysora f.sp. zeae is the casual agent of southern corn rust,  which has caused epidemics in Africa, North American and Asia for several times, seriously threatening the global food safety. With global warming, southern corn rust caused by Puccinia polysora has posed an increasing risk from tropical to temperate regions including China.

Here we used HIFI and Hi-C data, succesfully assembled P. polysora isolate GD1913 to haplotype-phased and chromosome level. Please find the manuscript in bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.18.492400. The accession number for assembled genome was under the accession number JAOOQA000000000 in NCBI and NMDC60042795 in NMDC. All raw reads (PacBio, Illumina, Hi-C and RNA-seq data) generated in this study are available both in NCBI and the National Microbiology Data Center (NMDC, https://nmdc.cn/) under the BioProject of PRJNA881038 and NMDC10018113, respectively

The scripts used to generate each figure are deposited in directories Figure-1, Figure-2, Figure-3 ....
